# Supervised Learning
 **Definition:**

A type of machine learning where the model is trained using labeled data.

"Labeled" means each input (X) has a correct output/answer (Y).

**Statement:**

The model learns the relationship between X (features) and Y (target), so it can predict Y for new X.

🌟 Example:

You have a dataset of students:

Study Hours (X)	Marks Scored (Y)
2	50
5	80
7	90

Here:

X = study hours

Y = marks

The model learns: "More study hours → more marks"

Model can predict:

If a student studies 6 hours → what marks will he get?

📌 Algorithms used:

Linear Regression

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

SVM

# Supervised Learning has 2 main types:

1. Regression

2. Classification


# Regression
# Definition:

Regression is a type of supervised learning used to predict continuous (numerical) values.

📌 Statement:

The model learns the relationship between features (X) and a continuous target (Y), and predicts a number.
