# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) allows computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves feeding data into algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions on new data. It is used in various applications like image recognition, speech processing, language translation, recommender systems, etc. In this article, we will see more about ML and its core concepts.


# What Makes a Machine "Learn"?
A machine "learns" by identifying patterns in data and improving its ability to perform specific tasks without being explicitly programmed for every scenario. This learning process helps machines to make accurate predictions or decisions based on the information they receive. Unlike traditional programming where instructions are fixed, ML allows models to adapt and improve through experience.

# Here is how the learning process works:

**Data Input:**
Machine needs data like text, images or numbers to analyze. Good quality and enough quantity of data are important for effective learning.

**Algorithms:**
Algorithms are mathematical methods that help the machine find patterns in data. Different algorithms help different tasks such as classification or regression.

**Model Training:** 
During training, the machine adjusts its internal settings to better predict outcomes. It learns by reducing the difference between its predictions and actual results.

**Feedback Loop:** 
Machine compares its predictions with true outcomes and uses this feedback to correct errors. Techniques like gradient descent help it update and improve.

**Experience and Iteration:**
Machine repeats training many times with data helps in refining its predictions with each pass, more data and iterations improve accuracy.

**Evaluation and Generalization:**
Model is tested on unseen data to ensure it performs well on real-world tasks.

Machines "learn" by continuously increasing their understanding through data-driven iterations like how humans learn from experience.


# Types of Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on building algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and improve with experience without explicit programming for every task. In simple words, Machine Learning teaches systems to learn patterns and make decisions like humans by analyzing and learning from data.

# Three Type Machine

**Supervised Machine Learning**

**Unsupervised Machine Learning**

**Reinforcement Learning**

Additionally, there is a more specific category called Semi-Supervised Learning and Self-Supervised Learning, which combines elements of both supervised and unsupervised learning


**Types of Machine Learning**

# 1. Supervised Machine Learning
Supervised learning is defined as when a model gets trained on a "Labeled Dataset". Labelled datasets have both input and output parameters. In Supervised Learning algorithms learn to map points between inputs and correct outputs. It has both training and validation datasets labelled.

There are two main categories of supervised learning that are mentioned below:

# 1. Classification
Classification predicts categorical outputs, meaning it assigns data into predefined classes like spam/non-spam emails or disease risk categories. These algorithms learn to map input features to discrete labels. Here are some classification algorithms:

**Logistic Regression**
**Support Vector Machine**
# 2. Regression
Regression, predicts continuous values, such as house prices or product sales. It learns the relationship between input features and a numerical target variable. Here are some regression algorithms:

**Linear Regression**
Polynomial Regression

**Where to Use Supervised Learning**

When you have labeled data and want to predict outcomes.(Linear Regression)

Ideal for classification (like spam detection) or regression tasks (like price forecasting).(Logistic Regression)

Best used in domains where historical data with outcomes is already available.
