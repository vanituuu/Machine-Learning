# Unsupervised Learning
# Definition:

A type of machine learning where the model is trained using unlabeled data.

There is no target Y, only features X.

📌 Statement:

The model tries to find patterns, groups, or hidden structures in the data by itself.
 **Example:**

-Customer data:

Age	Salary
20	15k
22	18k
45	60k
50	70k

Here:

No labels (no Y)

Only X

The model may find:

Group 1 → age 20–25, low salary

Group 2 → age 45–55, high salary

📌 Algorithms:

K-Means Clustering

PCA

Hierarchical Clustering
